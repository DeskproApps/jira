JIRA App
===

***Create Jira issues:*** Use the app to create Jira issues from Deskpro tickets without having to leave your ticket.

***Link issues to tickets:*** Linking issues to tickets in the app lets agents easily view information from Jira while interacting with users making communication more effective.

***Add comments to issues:*** Agents can comment on Jira issues from the app to add more information.

## Configuration
Set up requires the generation of an API key to authenticate the app. To generate an API key, go to account settings in Atlassian - the domain is the prefix at the start of your Jira site's URL.
